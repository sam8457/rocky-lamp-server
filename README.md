# Rocky Linux LAMP Server

A script to practice BASH in Linux.

This script installs PHP, MariaDB, and Apache on Rocky Linux (based on CentOS).
It then installs Nextcloud on top of those.

It also installs and configures a Samba share, and downloads and extracts 
[Hunt the Wumpus](https://github.com/sam8457/HuntTheWumpus) from another project.
